# Welcome to the Dfns WebAuthn2 App

Dfns aims to create the most secure and programmatic wallet-as-a-service platform. We want to make it easy for all developers, blockchain-savvy or not, to build Web3 products with great user experiences, and onboard the next billion users swiftly, without compromising on security. 

The question is how can we create a balance between usability and security, enabling millions of developers to create blockchain-based apps for billions of users? The solution is a decentralized network, designed by the world's leading experts in cybersecurity and cryptography, specifically to store and secure blockchain private key shares. Dfns provides a multi-party computation (MPC) based peer-to-peer network with integrated threshold recovery mechanisms, running on resilient tier 3/4 data centers. Our zero trust security model guarantees continuous operations, impartial governance, and eliminates all single points of failure (SPOFs) and single points of trust (SPOTs) throughout the wallet's lifetime.
